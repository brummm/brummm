### Hi there

Always looking to improve.

Full Stack Web Developer. Javascript and CSS expert. My favorite stack is the one that gets the job done (but other than that, NodeJs, React/Next and Sass ðŸ˜€)

Experienced with Java, AngularJS, React Native, Docker, Kubernetes, MongoDB, DB2 and even COBOL and game development. Can also draw.

Creativity is a strong point. Always looking for the best/simplest solution possible. I like TDD.

Been working almost exclusively at a large corporation intranet for the past ten years.
